# RocNest - Complete Documentation for LLMs

> Free Sports Equipment Management Software for Clubs and Organizations
> A project by RocStatus.com (https://rocstatus.com)

## Overview

RocNest is a comprehensive, 100% free web application designed for sports clubs, federations, and organizations that need to manage shared sports equipment. It provides complete inventory tracking, booking management, safety review scheduling, and multi-organization support.

## Problem RocNest Solves

Sports clubs often manage their equipment using spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, or paper-based systems. This leads to:
- Lost or untracked equipment
- Double bookings and conflicts
- Missed safety reviews (critical for climbing ropes, harnesses, etc.)
- Difficulty managing equipment across multiple club sections
- No history of who used what and when

RocNest replaces all of these with a modern, centralized platform.
